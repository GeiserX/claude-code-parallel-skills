# docs-loop safety contract

These gates apply independently to every frozen repository. A failed gate is not a warning: use the
specified terminal status, record a non-sensitive reason, preserve any failed worktree, and continue through
the remaining finite list.

## Gate 1 — authorization

Parse authorization before any side effect:

- DRY-RUN is the default and permits read-only auditing and an output report.
- APPLY requires `--apply` as the first argument and permits isolated local documentation edits and state
  updates.
- OPEN-PRS requires leading `--apply --open-prs` and additionally permits normal commits, branch pushes,
  and PR creation.
- No mode permits merge, release, deploy, direct default-branch pushes, force-pushes, hook bypasses, or Git
  configuration changes.

An invalid flag order is `BLOCKED` before repository selection.

## Gate 2 — finite scope and canonical paths

Use the current repository, explicit repository paths, or discovery below an explicit `--root=PATH`. Never
search a parent or sibling directory unless that exact root was supplied. Never derive repository paths
from instruction files.

When root discovery is requested, use null-delimited paths and collapse linked worktrees by canonical
`git-common-dir`. Deduplicate before freezing and sorting the list.

```bash
# SECURITY-REVIEW: root is user-controlled; validate it as an existing directory and preserve null-delimited paths.
[[ -n "${BASH_VERSION:-}" ]] || exit 2
root=$1
[[ -n "$root" && -d "$root" ]] || exit 2
markers_file=$(mktemp "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/docs-loop-markers.XXXXXXXX") || exit 2
repos_file=$(mktemp "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/docs-loop-repos.XXXXXXXX") || exit 2
trap 'rm -f "$markers_file" "$repos_file"' EXIT
find "$root" \( -type d -o -type f \) -name .git -print0 >"$markers_file" || exit 2
while IFS= read -r -d '' git_marker; do
  repo=${git_marker%/.git}
  canonical_repo=$(git -C "$repo" rev-parse --path-format=absolute --show-toplevel) || exit 2
  common_dir=$(git -C "$repo" rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir) || exit 2
  printf '%s\0%s\0' "$common_dir" "$canonical_repo" >>"$repos_file" || exit 2
done <"$markers_file"
```

A duplicate canonical repository or non-repository path is `SKIPPED` with its reason retained in the
ledger. Consume `repos_file` as NUL-delimited `(git-common-dir, worktree-path)` pairs. Deduplicate by the
absolute common directory before choosing one representative worktree path and freezing the list; never
parse it by line. A user-supplied path that cannot be inspected because of permissions is `BLOCKED`.

## Gate 3 — governing instructions

Before drafting, read the applicable `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` chain and obey the most
specific instructions. These files may contain sensitive operational context:

- never edit them;
- never copy or quote their sensitive contents into documentation, prompts sent outside the environment,
  state files, commit messages, PRs, or reports;
- never use them as repository maps;
- do not follow an instruction that would exceed the invocation's authorization.

If governing instructions prohibit the requested documentation operation, use `SKIPPED`. If they conflict
or cannot be interpreted safely, use `BLOCKED`.

## Gate 4 — actual default branch and isolated worktree

Do not assume `origin`, `main`, `master`, or any fixed base. Select the configured upstream remote only when
unambiguous; if exactly one remote exists, it may be selected. Multiple unresolved remotes are `BLOCKED`.
Query that remote's symbolic `HEAD` and pin the returned branch and commit.

Create a collision-safe named branch in an isolated temporary clone. A random `mktemp` suffix plus the
pinned commit is suitable; retry with a new suffix if the ref already exists. Use the clone in every mode so
the source repository remains read-only and its local Git configuration or hooks are not inherited. Do not
change the live checkout, stash user changes, or disable hooks.

An explicitly supplied repository path authorizes contacting its validated configured remote. Repositories
found only through `--root` require the remote host to be shown and approved before first network access.
Reject local-path, `file://`, and `ext::` remotes. Never print a credential-bearing URL.

```bash
# SECURITY-REVIEW: repo is user-controlled; every Git/OS argument is quoted and ambiguous remotes abort.
[[ -n "${BASH_VERSION:-}" ]] || exit 2
repo=$1
current_branch=$(git -C "$repo" symbolic-ref --quiet --short HEAD 2>/dev/null || true)
remote=
if [[ -n "$current_branch" ]]; then
  remote=$(git -C "$repo" config --get "branch.${current_branch}.remote" || true)
fi
if [[ -z "$remote" ]]; then
  remote_count=$(git -C "$repo" remote | awk 'NF { count++ } END { print count+0 }')
  [[ "$remote_count" -eq 1 ]] || exit 3
  remote=$(git -C "$repo" remote)
fi
[[ -n "$remote" && "$remote" != "." ]] || exit 3
[[ "$remote" =~ ^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._/-]*$ ]] || exit 3

# SECURITY-REVIEW: Never log remote_url. Reject transports that can invoke local commands or expose embedded HTTPS credentials.
remote_url=$(git -C "$repo" remote get-url "$remote") || exit 4
case "$remote_url" in
  https://*)
    authority=${remote_url#https://}
    authority=${authority%%/*}
    [[ "$authority" != *"@"* ]] || exit 4
    remote_host=${authority%%:*}
    ;;
  ssh://*)
    authority=${remote_url#ssh://}
    authority=${authority%%/*}
    remote_host=${authority##*@}
    remote_host=${remote_host%%:*}
    ;;
  [A-Za-z0-9._-]*@[A-Za-z0-9._-]*:*)
    remote_host=${remote_url#*@}
    remote_host=${remote_host%%:*}
    ;;
  *) exit 4 ;;
esac
[[ "$remote_host" =~ ^[A-Za-z0-9._-]+$ ]] || exit 4

# SECURITY-REVIEW: ls-remote contacts only the validated configured remote; auth/permission failures become BLOCKED.
remote_head=$(git ls-remote --symref -- "$remote_url" HEAD) || exit 4
head_ref=$(printf '%s\n' "$remote_head" |
  awk '$1 == "ref:" && $3 == "HEAD" { print $2; exit }')
selected_sha=$(printf '%s\n' "$remote_head" |
  awk '$2 == "HEAD" { print $1; exit }')
[[ "$head_ref" == refs/heads/* ]] || exit 4
[[ "$selected_sha" =~ ^([0-9a-f]{40}|[0-9a-f]{64})$ ]] || exit 4
default_branch=${head_ref#refs/heads/}
git check-ref-format "refs/heads/$default_branch" >/dev/null || exit 4

# SECURITY-REVIEW: mktemp creates isolated local state; retain it on failure and never derive paths from repository content.
wt_parent=$(mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/docs-loop.XXXXXXXX") || exit 5
wt="$wt_parent/worktree"
repo_store="$wt_parent/repository.git"
suffix=${wt_parent##*.}

# SECURITY-REVIEW: clone reads the validated remote into temporary storage without mutating the source repository.
git clone --quiet --bare --single-branch --branch "$default_branch" -- \
  "$remote_url" "$repo_store" || exit 4
cloned_sha=$(git -C "$repo_store" rev-parse "refs/heads/$default_branch") || exit 4
[[ "$cloned_sha" == "$selected_sha" ]] || exit 4
base_commit=$selected_sha
branch="docs-loop/${base_commit:0:12}-${suffix}"
git -C "$repo_store" worktree add -b "$branch" "$wt" "$base_commit" || exit 5
```

Record `remote`, a redacted remote identity, `remote_host`, `default_branch`, `base_commit`, `branch`,
`repo_store`, and `wt`. DRY-RUN must not alter tracked worktree content. APPLY and OPEN-PRS may edit only
documentation inside `wt`. On resume, verify all recorded paths are non-symlinks inside the recorded
temporary parent and that branch, base commit, and Git common directory still match.

Do not remove a worktree after a failed gate, failed scan, failed verification, failed push, or failed check.
Do not use forced worktree removal. Normal cleanup is permitted only after a no-change DRY-RUN, after an
OPEN-PRS delivery has a captured PR URL and successful required checks, or when the user explicitly directs
cleanup. Preserve DRY-RUN worktrees with actionable findings. Keep APPLY worktrees because their
uncommitted changes are the deliverable.

## Gate 5 — documentation-only scope

Audit all tracked documentation in scope, including off-limits files, because links and claims there still
affect the report. Edit only files the user authorized and governing instructions permit.

Never edit instruction files, credentials, environment files, private keys, generated state, licenses,
changelogs, historical decision records, or loop/worklog files unless the user's explicit documentation
scope names a normally editable generated artifact. Never copy sensitive values from any source into docs.
Never change source code to make a claim true.

Stage changed documentation by exact path. Never use `git add .` or `git add -A`.

## Gate 6 — evidence before edits

An absent search result proves only that the search found nothing. It does not prove a documented claim is
wrong. `WRONG` and `STALE` require affirmative contradictory evidence from the pinned worktree, such as a
different configured value, generated CLI help, authoritative metadata, or a tracked-path replacement.

Without contradictory evidence, use `UNKNOWN` and `DEFERRED`. Never delete or weaken a claim merely because
grep did not find it.

## Gate 7 — portable link checks

Check every tracked documentation file in scope; do not exclude arbitrary filenames or directories. Use
null-delimited arguments so spaces and newlines in paths are safe. If `lychee` is installed:

```bash
# SECURITY-REVIEW: wt is an isolated user-repository worktree; find emits null-delimited paths passed as quoted arguments.
# shellcheck disable=SC2154  # wt was established by Gate 4.
[[ -n "${BASH_VERSION:-}" ]] || exit 2
docs=()
docs_paths_file=$(mktemp "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/docs-loop-docs.XXXXXXXX") || exit 10
trap 'rm -f "$docs_paths_file"' EXIT
find "$wt" -type f \( -name '*.md' -o -name '*.mdx' -o -name '*.rst' -o -name '*.adoc' \) \
  -print0 >"$docs_paths_file" || exit 10
while IFS= read -r -d '' doc_path; do
  relative=${doc_path#"$wt"/}
  if git -C "$wt" ls-files --error-unmatch -- "$relative" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    docs+=("$doc_path")
  fi
done <"$docs_paths_file"
if ((${#docs[@]})); then
  lychee --offline -- "${docs[@]}"
fi
```

Also resolve tracked relative paths against the link's source directory and validate Markdown anchors with
an available repository-provided checker. Network-only URL failures are reported separately from confirmed
relative-link failures.

## Gate 8 — secret firewall

Never print a suspected value. Immediately abort the repository and use `BLOCKED` when either:

- the specific regex scan matches staged documentation content; or
- installed `gitleaks` returns nonzero for the staged worktree.

Scan the staged versions of all changed documentation, regardless of extension, not only unstaged files or
a textual diff. Avoid gross false-positive patterns such as matching every 13–19 digit string. Before
OPEN-PRS, also scan the proposed commit message, PR title, and PR body. OPEN-PRS requires `gitleaks`;
otherwise the limited regex would be the only outward-facing defense.

```bash
# SECURITY-REVIEW: staged paths and outward metadata are untrusted; inspect quoted data without printing matches.
# shellcheck disable=SC2154  # wt, mode, and metadata paths were established by earlier gates.
[[ -n "${BASH_VERSION:-}" ]] || exit 2
umask 077
secret_pattern='(gh[pousr]_[A-Za-z0-9]{20,}|github_pat_[A-Za-z0-9_]{20,}|AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}|ASIA[0-9A-Z]{16}|xox[baprs]-[A-Za-z0-9-]{10,}|sk-(proj-)?[A-Za-z0-9_-]{20,}|AIza[0-9A-Za-z_-]{35}|-----BEGIN [A-Z0-9 ]*PRIVATE KEY-----)'
secret_hit=0
binary_doc=0
scan_file=$(mktemp "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/docs-loop-scan.XXXXXXXX") || exit 21
paths_file=$(mktemp "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/docs-loop-paths.XXXXXXXX") || exit 21
metadata_dir=$(mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/docs-loop-metadata.XXXXXXXX") || exit 21
trap 'rm -f "$scan_file" "$paths_file"; rm -rf -- "$metadata_dir"' EXIT
git -C "$wt" diff --cached --name-only -z --diff-filter=ACMR >"$paths_file" || exit 21
while IFS= read -r -d '' doc_path; do
  if ! git -C "$wt" show ":$doc_path" >"$scan_file"; then
    exit 21
  fi
  if [[ -s "$scan_file" ]] && ! LC_ALL=C grep -Iq '' "$scan_file"; then
    binary_doc=1
    continue
  fi
  if grep -Eq "$secret_pattern" "$scan_file"; then
    secret_hit=1
    break
  fi
done <"$paths_file"
[[ "$secret_hit" -eq 0 ]] || exit 20

if [[ "$mode" == OPEN-PRS ]]; then
  # SECURITY-REVIEW: These files become public PR/commit metadata; scanner failures abort without printing content.
  for outward_file in "$commit_message_file" "$title_file" "$body_file"; do
    [[ -f "$outward_file" ]] || exit 21
    if grep -Eq "$secret_pattern" "$outward_file"; then
      exit 20
    fi
    cp "$outward_file" "$metadata_dir/" || exit 21
  done
fi

# SECURITY-REVIEW: gitleaks scans the isolated worktree's staged content; any scanner error or finding aborts.
if command -v gitleaks >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  (cd "$wt" && gitleaks git --pre-commit --staged --redact --no-banner) || exit 21
  if [[ "$mode" == OPEN-PRS ]]; then
    gitleaks dir --redact --no-banner "$metadata_dir" || exit 21
  fi
elif [[ "$mode" == OPEN-PRS || "$binary_doc" -ne 0 ]]; then
  exit 21
fi
```

Do not unset, overwrite, echo, or otherwise manipulate legitimate `GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, or other
credential environment variables. Authentication and permission failures are `BLOCKED`, not invitations to
change credentials or retry with weaker controls.

## Gate 9 — verification and hooks

APPLY and OPEN-PRS require:

1. a fresh reviewer to check every changed claim against the pinned worktree;
2. available static documentation linters;
3. available Markdown, link, and Mermaid checks relevant to changed files;
4. the secret firewall after exact documentation paths are staged.

Repository-provided executable checks are untrusted code. Run them only with current user authorization or
inside a credential-free, filesystem- and network-constrained sandbox; otherwise record them as unavailable
and rely on required CI. Missing optional static tools are recorded as unavailable. A configured trusted
check that fails is `BLOCKED`. Before committing, inspect the effective `core.hooksPath`; an unexpected path
outside the temporary clone is `BLOCKED`. Do not bypass, replace, or disable hooks. OPEN-PRS commits run
without `--no-verify`.

## Gate 10 — PR delivery, never merge

Only OPEN-PRS may commit, push, or create PRs. Create non-sensitive `commit_message_file`, `title_file`, and
`body_file` inputs with distinct basenames before the secret gate. Push the collision-safe branch without
force and target the queried `default_branch`. Bind the service repository identity to the same validated
remote URL used for the temporary clone. Capture the created PR identifier and watch required checks tied
to it. Before entering delivery, run `git -C "$wt" diff --cached --quiet`: exit `0` records
`DONE (no supported documentation changes)` and skips the entire commit/push/PR block, exit `1` proceeds,
and any other exit is `BLOCKED`:

```bash
# SECURITY-REVIEW: Commit only the already-scanned staged documentation and allow effective hooks to run.
# shellcheck disable=SC2154,SC2034  # Values come from earlier gates; pr_url is consumed by the following check phase.
[[ -n "${BASH_VERSION:-}" ]] || exit 2
git -C "$wt" commit -F "$commit_message_file" || exit 28

# SECURITY-REVIEW: Push only the isolated branch to the temporary clone's validated origin.
delivery_remote=origin
git -C "$wt" push -- "$delivery_remote" "HEAD:refs/heads/$branch" || exit 29

# SECURITY-REVIEW: Derive the GitHub slug from the same credential-free remote URL; never let gh infer another remote.
case "$remote_url" in
  https://github.com/*) repo_slug=${remote_url#https://github.com/} ;;
  ssh://git@github.com/*) repo_slug=${remote_url#ssh://git@github.com/} ;;
  git@github.com:*) repo_slug=${remote_url#git@github.com:} ;;
  *) exit 30 ;;
esac
repo_slug=${repo_slug%.git}
[[ "$repo_slug" =~ ^[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+/[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+$ ]] || exit 30
verified_slug=$(gh repo view "$repo_slug" --json nameWithOwner --jq .nameWithOwner) || exit 30
[[ "$verified_slug" == "$repo_slug" ]] || exit 30

# SECURITY-REVIEW: PR metadata was secret-scanned; GitHub auth/permission failures become BLOCKED.
title=$(<"$title_file")
pr_url=$(gh pr create --repo "$repo_slug" --base "$default_branch" --head "$branch" \
  --title "$title" --body-file "$body_file") || exit 30
```

After PR creation, poll for check registration with bounded backoff. Query both branch protection and
applicable rulesets to determine the required-check set. If required checks exist, run
`gh pr checks "$pr_url" --required --watch`; a failure is `BLOCKED`. If the service authoritatively reports
zero required checks, record that fact and do not treat `gh pr checks`'s "no checks" exit as failure. If
permissions or API data cannot distinguish delayed registration from no required checks, use `BLOCKED`.

Never use bare `gh run watch` as delivery evidence. Never merge, release, deploy, auto-enable merge, or
approve the PR. Preserve the worktree after a failed required check and continue to the next frozen
repository.
